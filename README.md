# Welcome to the Bokka Group Technical Test

This test is designed to analyse your problem solving abilities, there are no right or wrong answers, and no correct or incorrect methods. The test is broken up into three separate challenges, you are free to do the challenges in any order you deem fit. First is an array manipulation challenge where you'll be required to programmatically restructure an array. Second is a frontend challenge where you'll be asked to build a template from a static mockup. Third is a challenge to test your ability to work with git.
