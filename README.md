# Welcome to the Bokka Group Technical Test

This test is designed to analyse your problem solving abilities, there are no right or wrong answers, and no correct or incorrect methods. The test is broken up into three separate challenges, you are free to do the challenges in any order you deem fit. First, is a challenge to test your ability to work with git. Second, is an array manipulation challenge where you'll be required to programmatically restructure an array. Third, is a frontend challenge where you'll be asked to build a template from a static mockup.

## Array Manipulation

In the `array/` directory you will find a javascript file. In the file you will see there is a flat array of objects representing a navigation. There is an empty method called `childify`. The purpose of the `childify` method is to convert our flat array into a multidemensial array, so that subnav items live under their parent object. At the bottom of the file you will find an example of the expected output, along with a comparison that checks if your implementation is correct.

There is an included html file to allow you to run the script in your browser, each time you refresh the page it will analyze the arrays and let you know if you've completed the test.

## Frontend Challenge

For the frontend challenge you will be required to build out a design from a mockup from scratch. Inside the `frontend/` directory you will find the mockup (`mockup.jpg`), a basic `index.html`, and an assets directory that includes all the images you will need & a CSS file that is already linked in `index.html`.

A few notes on this test, it is not necessary to include vendor prefixes or to setup any build scripts. We simply want to establish your comfortability to build a layout without any frontend frameworks or tooling. Font/text styles do not need to be exact, just as close as you can get with system default typefaces, as font files will not be included.
