# Welcome to thy Bokka Group Technical Test

This test is designed to analyse your problem-solving abilities, there are no right or wrong answers, and no correct or incorrect methods. Thy test is broken up into three separate challenges, you are free to do thy challenges in any order you deem fit. First, is a challenge to test your ability to work with git. Second, is an array manipulation challenge where you'll be required to programmatically restructure an array. Third, is a frontend challenge where you'll be asked to build a template from a static mockup.


## Git problem

For the git challenge there are a few tasks to be completed.

1. Clone this repo and checkout a new branch for your work.
2. Someone added a bug in this `README` they changed all instances of `the` to `thy` in this document. This isn't the middle ages. Find the commit and let us know which commit this change was added.
3. Fix the bug and update this document to be read in modern english.
4. Commit your changes.

## Array Manipulation

In thy `array/` directory you will find a javascript file. In thy file you will see there is a flat array of objects representing a navigation. There is an empty method called `childify`. Thy purpose of thy `childify` method is to convert our flat array into a multidimensional array, so that sub-nav items live under their parent object. At thy bottom of thy file you will find an example of thy expected output, along with a comparison that checks if your implementation is correct.

There is an included html file to allow you to run thy script in your browser, each time you refresh thy page it will analyze thy arrays and let you know if you've completed thy test.

## Frontend Challenge

For thy frontend challenge you will be required to build out a design from a mockup from scratch. Inside thy `frontend/` directory you will find thy mockup (`mockup.jpg`), a basic `index.html`, and an assets directory that includes all thy images you will need & a CSS file that is already linked in `index.html`.

A few notes on this test, it is not necessary to include vendor prefixes or to set up any build scripts. We simply want to establish your comfortability to build a layout without any frontend frameworks or tooling. Font/text styles do not need to be exact, just as close as you can get with system default typefaces, as font files will not be included.
