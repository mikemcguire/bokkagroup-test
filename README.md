# Welcome to the Bokka Group Technical Test

This test is designed to analyse your problem solving abilities, there are no right or wrong answers, and no correct or incorrect methods. The test is broken up into three separate challenges, you are free to do the challenges in any order you deem fit. First is an array manipulation challenge where you'll be required to programmatically restructure an array. Second is a frontend challenge where you'll be asked to build a template from a static mockup. Third is a challenge to test your ability to work with git.




## Array Manipulation

In the `array/` directory you will find a javascript file. In the file you will see there is a flat array of objects representing a navigation. There is an empty method called `childify`. The purpose of the `childify` method is to convert our flat array into a multidemensial array, so that subnav items live under their parent object. At the bottom of the file you will find an example of the expected output, along with a comparison that checks if your implementation is correct.

You can either run the file via `node` or there is an included html file to allow you to run the script in your browser (logged out to the dev console).
